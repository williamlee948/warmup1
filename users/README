 This directory contains testing files for the Login Counter Warmup project for CS169.

 To run a mock server:
       python server.py
   - this will run a web server on port 8080 on localhost

 To manually test the mock server using the HTML client:
    open a browser and point it to http://localhost:8080/client.html

 To run unit tests for the mock server backend:
    make unit_tests

 To run functional tests for the mock server backend:
    [start a server]
    make func_tests [TEST_SERVER=serverHostPort]

    - the TEST_SERVER environment variable can be set to the hostname:port for the server to test, e.g., foo.com:8080.
      (defaults to localhost:8080)

    - this will search for all files test*.py in the current directory for tests to run

 To write more functional tests:
    - You should write more functional tests, in Python, following the model of the
       tests in testSimple.py. Put your tests in a file "testAdditional.py"
       next to testSimple.py

 To run functional tests for YOUR actual server
    - [start your server, either on localhost, or perhaps on Heroku] 
    make func_test TEST_SERVER=serverHostPort
